# Team Forming/Norming & Community Agreements

## List team members' names & information

-	Shubhangi Srivastava  |  ssrivast@ucdavis.edu
- Andrew Tom  | amtom@ucdavis.edu
-	Iris Xie | ixie@ucdavis.edu
-	Adam Zhu | admzhu@ucdavis.edu
-	Graham Sarasy | gpsarasy@ucdavis.edu

## What style of collaboration will you use? (Will you have a designated team leader, for example, or will you share the responsibility for keeping everyone on task? Will one person write and another edit, or will everyone write together?)
-	I expect that when we have tasks, that we create deadlines for ourselves to submit by, and then we can all agree on it. If someone is unable to meet it, they must inform the rest of the group, so we can all communicate and decide who picks up the work. I expect people to hold themselves accountable for the work, and all of us have a shared understanding of what accountability is. Deciding on the best way to do the task will be dependent on what the assignment is. - Iris
-	I really think we should all be keeping each other accountable, taking initiatives, and starting productive discussions. One single person shouldn’t be responsible for keeping an entire group in line, delegating tasks, or creating nightly assignments; everyone should be involved in the conversation, because in my experience otherwise, people tend to get “lazy” or do as much as is asked and nothing more. Everyone has a stake in making this project successful, and each person has a unique brand of leadership to bring to the table. Also, tasks certainly should be delegated keeping in mind people’s strengths, weaknesses, what they’re comfortable, or what someone wants to work more on. -Shubhangi

## What tools will your team use to collaborate?
-	Piazza - for posting googledoc links & important “homeworks” for the group (like a table of contents)
-	GoogleDocs - for the main brainstorming and deliverables related to the project
-	Cell Phones (or email!)  for updates and questions on the fly

## What will your group do if a team member does not follow through on an assigned task or does not perform to someone else's satisfaction?
-	If a team member can’t follow up on an assigned task (like for me, if I’m away on a River Survey for my internship) I’ll let you all know ahead of time via email or text.  Hopefully if we all let each other know ahead of time when we’re not / we can’t follow through on assignments, the others can compensate? - Andrew
-	I think we must do check-ins regularly to see how the group is going, and if anyone is feeling like they are falling behind/having to do too much work. If everyone is conscientious and self-aware of the work that they are doing/sharing with the group, it should be fine, but I strongly expect everyone to avoid this as much as possible. Before signing up for tasks, know your schedule and skill limitations. Before the task starts, please ask for help if working with another group member will help you complete that assignment. - Iris
-	Please communicate with your fellow teammates. If you’re going to be unavailable the night before a deadline, and still haven’t uploaded your share of the work, other members will certainly be concerned. So please let others know of the status of your work, what kind of progress you’re making, if you’re having trouble with anything, when you plan on finishing it, etc. - Shubhangi

## How will your team address conflict? (Are team members conflict-averse, or do you all welcome conflict?)  Note: Please take the time to discuss how you approach conflict, and how you’d like conflict to approach you. Some people shut down. Others are combative. It is important to understand one another before problems occur.
-	Andrew: If I’m not doing what I need to be doing, please let me know in person, email, text, whatever.  I am very chill with conflict.  If I’m concerned with someone else, I typically will let you know too, but I have a pretty high “concern” threshold so not a lot bothers me..
-	I think it’s incredibly important for everyone to feel listened to, and included. If someone is not feeling included or listened to, or if there is difficulty, I think it’s important to discuss as a group how to support that person and each other. - Iris

## List your team's main milestones and state who is the project lead responsible for completing each milestone. For example, as a team we will be framing our research, making interim reports, and writing and presenting a final report, etc.
